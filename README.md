# URI Encode/Decode

This is a simple extension that encodes or decodes a piece of text as a whole URI (URL) or as a
URI component, i.e. query parameter, using the JavaScript `encodeURI()` and `encodeURIComponent()`
functions.

## Features

![Demo](demo.gif)

* Select a URI and open command palette -> `Encode as URI` or `Decode as URI` to encode/decode it
  as a whole URI. This ensures that only the necessary parts are encoded, i.e. query parameters.

* Select a part of a URI and open command palette -> `Encode as URI Component` or 
  `Decode as URI Component` to encode/decode as a URI parameter. 
  
  Usually you only want to use this if you select the value of some parameter after the `=` sign 
  and you want to encode/decode only that part.
